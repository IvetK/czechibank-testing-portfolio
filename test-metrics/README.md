## üìã Test Coverage

### API Testing Coverage

**Complete endpoint coverage across all major API categories:**

| API Category | Endpoints Tested | Coverage |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| **Users** | 3 | üü¢ Complete |
| **Bank Accounts** | 5 | üü¢ Complete |
| **Transactions** | 3 | üü¢ Complete |
| **Total** | **11** | **üü¢ 100%** |

**Testing Approach:**
- ‚úÖ Happy path scenarios
- ‚úÖ Authorization testing (valid, invalid, missing, expired, deleted API keys)
- ‚úÖ Boundary value analysis
- ‚úÖ Invalid input validation
- ‚úÖ Error handling verification
- ‚úÖ Edge case coverage

---

### Functional Testing

**Comprehensive test case documentation covering:**

- **User Registration & Authentication** - Account creation, login, logout flows
- **Bank Account Management** - CRUD operations, validation, lifecycle
- **Money Transfers** - Transaction creation, validation, history
- **API Key Management** - Generation, usage, security
- **Profile Management** - User data, avatar, settings
- **UI/Responsive Design** - Cross-browser, mobile compatibility

**Total Test Cases:** 50+ documented and executed

## üîç Testing Techniques Applied

Multiple systematic testing techniques were employed to ensure comprehensive coverage:

| Technique | Application | Key Discoveries |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Exploratory Testing** | Session management, UI flows | Critical session bug, UX issues |
| **Boundary Value Analysis** | Amount validation, input limits | Edge case bugs, validation gaps |
| **Equivalence Partitioning** | API key states, user inputs | Authorization issues |
| **Negative Testing** | Invalid inputs, error scenarios | Error handling bugs |
| **Security Testing** | Authentication, session, API keys | Multiple security vulnerabilities |
| **Data-Driven Testing** | CSV-based API scenarios | Systematic API validation |

---

## üìä Test Data 

### CSV Test Scenarios

Systematic data-driven testing approach using CSV files for repeatable API testing:

| File | Scenarios | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `transactions_scenarios.csv` | 6 | Transaction ID validation + authorization |
| `transaction_flow_scenarios.csv` | 12 | E2E transaction testing + validation |
| `user_auth_scenarios.csv` | 12 | Authentication state testing |
| **Total** | **30** | **Data-driven API testing** |

Each scenario includes:
- Test scenario name
- Input parameters (API keys, IDs, amounts)
- Expected HTTP status codes
- Authorization state variations

---

### Postman Collection

**Professional API testing framework:**

- **15 organized API requests** covering all endpoints
- **4 logical folders:** Users, Bank Accounts, Transactions, About
- **Reusable structure** for regression testing
- **Environment variables** for flexible testing
- **Downloadable collection** for team collaboration

The Postman collection serves as both a testing tool and API documentation, providing clear examples of request/response patterns.

## üéØ Test Environment

### Browser Compatibility

Testing was conducted across multiple browsers to ensure consistent behavior:

| Browser | Platform | Coverage |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Chrome** | macOS | Primary testing browser |
| **Safari** | macOS | Cross-browser validation |

**Findings:**
- UI rendering differences identified
- Session handling variations discovered
- Responsive design issues on mobile Safari

### Device Testing

| Device Type | Testing Focus |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Desktop** | Full functionality, primary use case |
| **Mobile (iPhone)** | Responsive design, touch interactions |

---

## üí° Key Insights

### Most Effective Testing Approaches

1. **Exploratory Testing**
   - Discovered the critical session invalidation vulnerability
   - Revealed unexpected behavior through guided exploration
   - Uncovered UX issues not covered by formal test cases

2. **Systematic API Authentication Testing**
   - Testing all authentication states (valid, missing, invalid, expired, deleted)
   - Found multiple authorization gaps and error handling issues
   - Revealed inconsistent API responses

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identified predictable API key generation pattern
   - Discovered security vulnerability through observation
   - Highlighted need for cryptographic randomness

### High-Risk Areas Identified

Based on bug discoveries, these areas require additional attention:

1. **Session Management** - Critical security vulnerability found
2. **API Error Handling** - Inconsistent responses across endpoints
3. **Security Patterns** - Predictable key generation
4. **Input Validation** - Edge cases not properly handled
5. **Mobile Responsiveness** - UI overlap issues

### Areas of Excellence

The application demonstrated strength in:

1. **Core CRUD Operations** - Bank accounts and transactions work reliably
2. **Basic UI Functionality** - Main user flows are stable
3. **API Pagination** - Properly implemented across list endpoints
4. **Data Persistence** - Transaction history accurately maintained
