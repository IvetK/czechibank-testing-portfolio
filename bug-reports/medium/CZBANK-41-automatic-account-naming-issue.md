# [CZBANK-41] Bank Account Creation - Duplicate Default Names

**Priority:** Medium  
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** Done / Fixed  
**Reporter:** Iveta Kuklov√°  
**Date Reported:** July 8, 2025  
**Resolution:** Fixed in new release  
**Verification:** Retested - works correctly now

## üìã Summary

When creating multiple bank accounts via API endpoint `POST /bank-account/create`, all accounts received the identical default name "New Bank Account" with no differentiation. This made it impossible for users to distinguish between accounts, creating significant usability issues.

**Resolution:** Fixed in subsequent release with sequential numbering ("New Bank Account 01, 02, 03...") and addition of UI functionality allowing custom account names.

---

## üîç Description

### Original Issue

At the time of discovery, bank accounts could only be created via API (no UI functionality existed). When testing account creation through Postman:

**Problem:**
- API did not accept a "name" parameter
- System assigned default name: **"New Bank Account"**
- **ALL accounts received the IDENTICAL name**
- No sequential numbering or differentiation

**Impact:**
When user created multiple accounts:
```
Account 1: "New Bank Account"
Account 2: "New Bank Account"  ‚Üê IDENTICAL name!
Account 3: "New Bank Account"  ‚Üê IDENTICAL name!
```

Users could not distinguish their accounts by name, causing:
- Confusion when selecting accounts
- Risk of sending money to wrong account
- Poor user experience
- Need to check account numbers or balances to identify accounts

---

## üåê Environment

**Testing Environment:**
- Application: CzechiBank (educational banking application)
- Environment: Development
- API Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/bank-account/create`
- Testing Tool: Postman
- Date Discovered: July 8, 2025

**Original Limitation:**
- Bank accounts could ONLY be created via API
- No frontend UI functionality available
- API was the only method for account creation

---

## üìù Steps to Reproduce (Original Bug)

### Prerequisites
- Valid user account with API key
- Access to Postman

### Reproduction Steps

**Step 1: Create new bank Account**
```
POST https://[dev-environment]/api/v1/bank-account/create

Headers:
  x-api-key: [valid-api-key]

Body:
{
  "currency": "CZECHITOKEN"
}

Response:
{
  "name": "New Bank Account"  ‚Üê Default name assigned
}
```

**Step 2: Create Second Account**
```
POST /bank-account/create
Body: { "currency": "CZECHITOKEN" }

Response:
{
  "name": "New Bank Account"  ‚Üê SAME name as Account 1!
}
```


**Step 3: View Accounts**
```
GET /bank-account

Response shows all accounts with identical names:
[
  { "name": "New Bank Account" },
  { "name": "New Bank Account" },
  { "name": "New Bank Account" }
]
```

**Result:** User cannot distinguish accounts by name.

---

## üéØ Expected Behavior

**Accounts should be distinguishable:**

### Option 1: Accept Custom Names
Allow users to specify account names via API:
```json
POST /bank-account/create
Body:
{
  "currency": "CZECHITOKEN",
  "name": "Personal Savings"
}
```

### Option 2: Sequential Default Naming
If no name provided, use unique default names:
```
Account 1: "New Bank Account 01"
Account 2: "New Bank Account 02"
Account 3: "New Bank Account 03"
```

### Option 3: UI Functionality
Provide frontend interface where users can:
- Create accounts through UI
- Specify custom names during creation
- Distinguish accounts visually

---

## üêõ Actual Behavior (Original Bug)

**What was happening:**

1. **No Name Parameter Support**
   - API did not accept "name" field
   - Even if provided, it was ignored
   - No way to customize account name

2. **Identical Default Names**
   - System always assigned: "New Bank Account"
   - No numbering, no differentiation
   - Every account had the exact same name

3. **No UI Alternative**
   - Only API method available
   - Frontend had no account creation feature
   - Users forced to use API

4. **User Confusion**
   - Account list showed duplicate names
   - Impossible to identify correct account
   - Had to check account numbers or balances
   - Risk of selecting wrong account for transfers

---

## üí• Impact Assessment

### Original Severity: MEDIUM

**User Experience Impact:**
- **High**: Completely unable to distinguish accounts by name
- **Medium**: Increased risk of user errors (wrong account selection)
- **High**: Poor usability, non-intuitive interface

**Frequency:**
- **High**: Affected every user with multiple accounts
- Occurred 100% of the time

**Business Impact:**
- Violated banking UX best practices
- Users expected ability to name/identify accounts
- Standard feature missing from application

---

## ‚úÖ Resolution & Fix

### What Was Implemented

The development team implemented a comprehensive fix in a new release:

**1. UI Functionality Added** ‚úÖ
- Frontend now includes account creation interface
- Users can create accounts directly through UI
- Custom naming available during creation

**2. API Enhanced** ‚úÖ
- API now accepts "name" parameter
- Users can specify custom account names via API
- Validation added for name field

**3. Improved Default Naming** ‚úÖ
- Sequential numbering implemented
- Default names now: "New Bank Account 01", "New Bank Account 02", etc.
- Each account receives unique identifier

**Example After Fix:**
```

‚Üí "New Bank Account 01"
‚Üí "New Bank Account 02"
‚Üí "New Bank Account 03"

Or user provides custom names:
‚Üí "Personal Savings"
‚Üí "Business Account"
‚Üí "Emergency Fund"
```

Result: ‚úÖ All accounts distinguishable
Status: PASS - No duplicate names
```

**Overall Verification:** ‚úÖ **BUG RESOLVED**

## üí¨ Communication History

**Initial Report:**
